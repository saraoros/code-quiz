# Code Quiz Targeted Goals:

- When the user is taking this code quiz, a timer starts at the click of the 'start' button.
- As the user answers a question, then they will be presented with another question.
- If the user answers a question incorrectly, then time is subtracted from the clock.
- When the timer reaches zero or when the questions are all answered, then the game is over.
- After the game is over, then the user can save their initials and score.
